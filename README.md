# Phase 1 Project
# Kengeles Aviation

In this project we are studying 'Kengele Aviation' a fictious company that is interested in venturing into the aviation industry as a diversification from it's main investment portfolio.

The dataset was obtained from The NTSB aviation accident database containing information from 1962 and later about civil aviation accidents and selected incidents within the United States, its territories and possessions, and in international waters.

The dataset includes information on various aspects, such as aircraft make and model, injury severity, aircraft damage and the purpose of the flight.

In our approach we shall focus on the key insights for the aviation company in starting up its local business.
